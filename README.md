# üß† Mental Health & Social Media Balance Dashboard

### üéì Python Data Analysis Final Project  
**Tools:** Streamlit ¬∑ Plotly ¬∑ Scikit-learn ¬∑ Statsmodels  

---

## üåç Project Overview

This project analyzes the **relationship between social media usage, sleep quality, stress level, physical activity, and overall happiness**.  
The main goal is to explore behavioral factors affecting **mental wellbeing** and to develop a synthetic indicator called the **Digital Wellbeing Index (DWI)** that quantifies one‚Äôs digital-life balance.  

The dashboard provides an interactive, data-driven interface for visual exploration and predictive modeling of happiness levels based on lifestyle habits.

**üí° 4. Insight & Recommendation**

    Summarized insights and recommendations for improving mental wellbeing:

    üîç Key Findings

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Users spending >8 hours/day on social media have higher stress and lower happiness.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Good sleep quality (‚â•7/10) strongly correlates with happiness.
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Exercising ‚â•3 times/week significantly reduces stress.
    4Ô∏è‚É£ Users of Instagram/YouTube tend to be happier than heavy TikTok/Twitter users.

    üß≠ Recommendations

        ‚è≥ Limit daily social media use to <5 hours.

        üò¥ Maintain 7‚Äì8 hours of sleep each night.

        üèÉ Engage in physical activity 3‚Äì4 times/week.

        üßò Practice digital detox periodically.

        ‚ù§Ô∏è Follow positive content, avoid toxic media.

    üìå Conclusion

    A balanced lifestyle between Screen Time, Sleep, Stress, and Exercise
    directly enhances happiness and psychological wellbeing.

**üìö Main Insights**

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Excessive screen time is directly linked to higher stress.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Sleep quality and exercise are strong predictors of happiness.
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Cluster 2 represents the healthiest, most balanced user group.
    4Ô∏è‚É£ Random Forest achieved R¬≤ = 0.82, outperforming Linear Regression (R¬≤ = 0.69).
    5Ô∏è‚É£ The Error vs Predicted plot confirms no major model bias.

**üß† Conclusion**

    The analysis confirms that Screen Time, Sleep, Stress, and Exercise
    jointly shape an individual‚Äôs Happiness Index.

    The proposed Digital Wellbeing Index provides a meaningful, quantifiable framework
    to assess and promote healthier digital habits for better mental health.
